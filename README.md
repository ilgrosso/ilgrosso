My name is Francesco Chicchiricc√≤, and my surname has been a tricky challenge since I was born in 1977, every time I had to get in touch with any public office; the advent of Internet made things even more cumbersome, despite of Unicode effort :-)

<p>I am currently ASF member, <a href="http://syncope.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Apache Syncope</a> PMC chair, <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Apache Cocoon</a>,<a href="http://olingo.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Apache Olingo</a>, <a href="http://cxf.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Apache CXF</a>, <a href="http://openjpa.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Apache OpenJPA</a> PMC member and <a href="http://ponymail.incubator.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Apache Pony Mail</a> PPMC member.</p>

Linux - then [Debian](https://www.debian.org), what else? - addict since 1997, I have discovered [Kde neon](https://neon.kde.org/) in the last years.

I am Italian (and proud to be), married with my lovely wife Cinzia, father of a sweet girl Sara and of two wonderful boys Davide and Mattia. Since I was a child I've always loved comics and music, playing bass guitar in a few metal rock bands with some friends.

<p>About Computer Science, I got a master degree in 2001 in L'Aquila, after six months spent at Nokia Research Center in Heksinki (about this, you can take a look at a <a href="https://home.apache.org/~ilgrosso/linusphoto.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">photo</a> I took at that time with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a friend of mine</a> :-P). Since then I've been working as developer, analyst and architect for some companies until I've established in 2004 my first IT company, ePOSSE. After seven years, I decided to start again from scratch with a brand new Open Source based company, <a href="https://www.tirasa.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tirasa</a>, aiming to speed up the development and the adoption of <a href="http://syncope.tirasa.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Syncope</a>.</p>

<p>In 2006 I had the chance to meet Gianugo Rabellino, at a common customer's place, that introduced to me the world of Apache Software Foundation in general and <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cocoon</a> in particular.</p>

<p>Besides ASF, I am project owner of <a href="https://connid.tirasa.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ConnId</a>.</p>
